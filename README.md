# Custom-Powershell-Commands
A place for cool, easy breezy cmdlets to use in powershell because why not, especially if you are a die hard bash/linux fan, then you can create your own linuxy cmdlets here. 

## Install Modules
To install all the modules just run the installModules.ps1 script.

## Add Script to Powershell Profile
This will ensure the custom modules will install everytime you open a new powershell terminal so you don't have to do it every single time!

## Why .psm1 instead of .ps1?
The reason is simple.... tab completion! 
(There is other reasons but you probable already know them so no need to explain. If not, google it...)
